        <div class="panel" id="panel-2">
        <p>By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure
        therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the
        app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the
        source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages, or make
        derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual
        property rights related to it, still belong to EyBeeStudios.</p> <p>EyBeeStudios is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For
        that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time
        and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear
        to you exactly what you’re paying for.</p> <p>The FreeBitcoin Assistant app stores authentication data that you have provided, in order to provide
        my Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore
        recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions
        and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable
        to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that
        the FreeBitcoin Assistant app won’t work properly or at all. </p> <p>You should be aware that there are certain things that EyBeeStudios will not take responsibility
        for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection
        can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but EyBeeStudios cannot take responsibility
        for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any
        of your data allowance left.
        </p><p></p><p>If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the
          agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by
          your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the
          app, or other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such
          charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region
          or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which
          you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill
          payer for using the app.</p> <p>Along the same lines, EyBeeStudios cannot always take responsibility for the way you use
          the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and
          you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, EyBeeStudios cannot accept responsibility.</p> <p>With respect to EyBeeStudios’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using
          the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and
          correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make
          it available to you. EyBeeStudios accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect,
          you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.</p> <p>At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android – the
          requirements for system (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability
          of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the
          app. EyBeeStudios does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant
          to you and/or works with the Android version that you have installed on your device. However,
          you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to
          stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination
          to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to
          you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your
          device.
        </p> <p><strong>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</strong></p> <p> I may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised
          to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any
          changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page. These changes are effective immediately
          after they are posted on this page.
        </p> <p><strong>Contact Us</strong></p> <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about my Terms and Conditions, do not hesitate
